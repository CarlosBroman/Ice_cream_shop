# Icecream stock application: building python applications at different difficulty levels.

I was presented with the task of creating an application to manage the stocks of an icecream shop.
I decided to start building with Python, since it is my main programming language.

Here, you can find different versions of the application, following the same development path I took.

The application has to:
    - Prompt the user for what operation they wish to perform: (generate new entry, view a chart with the stocks, view the stock as a list)
    - Allow to create new flavours


### Version 1:
    The interactivity is provided within the terminal.
